/**
 * Every setting that exists today must be reachable from {@link LegacyConfigMap}.
 *
 * <p>A key the table forgets is not a crash and not a warning. The migration simply never writes
 * it, the new file keeps its default, and the pack author finds out weeks later that one of their
 * settings quietly reset itself. So the check has to be mechanical rather than a promise that
 * somebody remembered.
 *
 * <p>{@code Config} is read as text rather than reflected over, because {@code ModConfigSpec} is
 * not on the test classpath — build.gradle keeps NeoForge out of the test source set, which is
 * also why {@link LegacyConfigMap} itself is written in plain strings. Same trick as
 * {@code ApiSurfaceGuardTest}.
 *
 * <p>Reading source text means the parser can silently go wrong, so it is held to a floor as well
 * as to the table: a parser that stops finding keys would otherwise pass by finding none.
 *
 * <p>Delete this alongside {@link LegacyConfigMap} in {@value LegacyConfigMap#REMOVE_IN}.
