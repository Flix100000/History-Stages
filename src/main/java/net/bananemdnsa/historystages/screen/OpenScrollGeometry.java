 * is that drawn region, and the sheet is blitted at a negative offset so Minecraft centres the
 * screen on what the player actually sees — the pedestal screen sat 23px too high until it was
 * done this way.
 *
 * <p>Every constant is panel-relative (sheet coordinate minus the sheet origin). Deliberately free
 * of Minecraft types so the arithmetic is unit-testable.
 *
 * <p>The overview page has no constants here on purpose: its blocks flow from the top of the
 * content band, one under the other, so their positions depend on the config's block order and
 * cannot be written down in advance.
