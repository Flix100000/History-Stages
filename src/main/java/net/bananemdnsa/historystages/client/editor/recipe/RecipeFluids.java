/**
 * Reads a recipe's fluid side map the way the picker needs it.
 *
 * <p>The two questions get different answers on purpose. An entry in the left column claims "this
 * recipe makes that fluid", and a claim has to be certain — an unclassified fluid would file a
 * recipe under something it may only consume, and that column is what one navigates by. The card
 * is the opposite: it has to show every fluid the lock acts on, including the ones whose side we
 * could not read, or the editor would know less than the gate it exists to explain.
 *
 * <p>No Minecraft type appears here, which is what lets both rules be pinned by a test.
