 * Everything known about one node of the stage graph, as a window rather than a docked column.
 *
 * <p>The docked panel this replaces was 190px wide, which a stage with several requirement
 * kinds turned into eight stacked sections of mostly chrome. A window can take the width it
 * needs, so the content is simply listed: no collapsing, no separators per section, no marquee.
 *
 * <p>Modal on purpose. At this size the map behind it would be too far covered to be worth
 * keeping live, and {@link AbstractModalScreen} already draws the graph dimmed behind the box.
 * Its draw depth matters more than it looks: the base lifts the whole dialog above the ~232
 * that {@code GuiGraphics.renderItem} draws at, which is what lets this screen show real item
 * icons without them punching through the frame.
 *
 * <p>Requirement rows render {@link RequirementResult} exactly as received from
 * {@link ClientDependencyCache} and never re-derive fulfilment — the same rule the docked panel
 * carried. Rows are rebuilt whenever the cache version changes, because the reply to a
 * dependency request can land while this screen is already open.
