/**
 * Everything the stage editor needs in order to show one lock category as a tab, without knowing
 * which category it is.
 *
 * <p>A tab has always been spread across seventeen places in the editor — an edit field, a
 * picker, six input-forwarding calls, a render call, a visibility check, a load and a store, plus
 * a handful of index branches. Gathering that behind one type is what lets a category the editor
 * has never heard of appear as an ordinary tab.
 *
 * <p>Loading and storing are not reimplemented here: they go through
 * {@link net.bananemdnsa.historystages.data.lock.category.LockCategory#read} and
 * {@code write}, so a tab and a lock check can never disagree about where a category's entries
 * live.
