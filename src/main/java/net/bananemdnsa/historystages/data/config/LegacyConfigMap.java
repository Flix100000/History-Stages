/**
 * Where every setting from the pre-6.0 config files lives now.
 *
 * <p>Up to 5.x the settings were split by <em>who owned the value</em>:
 * {@code historystages-client.toml} for the ones each player set for themselves,
 * {@code historystages-common.toml} for the ones the server decided. 6.0 splits them by
 * <em>what the value does</em> instead — {@code visual.toml} for everything a player sees, reads
 * or hears, {@code gameplay.toml} for everything that happens in the background. So a setting can
 * cross files, and two blocks did not survive the move: {@code [messages]} split into one visual
 * key and the new {@code [logging]} block, and the notification half of
 * {@code [individual_stages]} became {@code [notifications.individual]}.
 *
 * <p>Nothing here touches NeoForge, nightconfig or Minecraft on purpose. This table is the part
 * worth guarding with a plain JUnit test, and the test source set has none of those on its
 * classpath — see build.gradle. {@link LegacyConfigMigration} is where the file reading and the
 * spec writing happen.
 *
 * <p><strong>Delete in {@value #REMOVE_IN}.</strong> By then every pack that was going to update
 * has updated, and a table this size only rots once nothing exercises it. Delete alongside it:
 * {@link LegacyConfigMigration}, {@code LegacyConfigMapCoverageTest}, and the two
 * {@code LegacyConfigMigration} calls in {@code HistoryStages} — the {@code capture()} in the mod
 * constructor and the {@code apply()} in the config-loading listener.
