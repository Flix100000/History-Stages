/**
 * The client's own config values, as they stood before a server pushed its own over them.
 *
 * <p>A sync writes the server's values straight into the spec objects in memory; the player's file
 * on disk is never touched. Nothing used to put those values back, so a client kept a visited
 * server's settings until the game was restarted. That was barely noticeable while only gameplay
 * values travelled. Now that the visual ones do too, leaving a server would carry its tooltips,
 * lock icons and screen overlays straight into the next singleplayer world.
 *
 * <p>The snapshot is taken by the sync handler itself, immediately before it applies anything —
 * the one moment the spec is certain to hold the local file's contents. An earlier design hooked
 * {@code ModConfigEvent.Loading} instead, which fails twice over: that event fires on a dedicated
 * server as well, and {@code LoadedConfig.save()} fires {@code Reloading}, so an admin's own save
 * would have been recorded as if it were the local baseline.
 *
 * <p>Deliberately free of {@code net.minecraft.client} imports so a dedicated server can load it
 * and a GameTest can exercise it. Whether a snapshot should be taken at all is a question only a
 * client can answer, so that decision stays at the call sites — see
 * {@code SyncVisualConfigPacket.apply}.
