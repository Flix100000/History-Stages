 * The subjects the built-in lock categories are asked about.

 * about its own type. Three of the built-in questions need more than a bare id, and these records
 * are that "more". They are built in the engine and nowhere else.
 *
 * <p>Two of them name Minecraft types in their canonical constructors, which makes them types no
 * unit test can construct. That is fine while they are internal. It is <em>not</em> fine to freeze
 * them into the public API in Phase 9 without a Minecraft-free factory beside them — the same
 * trap {@code EntryActionContext.dataOnly} exists for. Noted in the Phase 8 design, §6.1.
