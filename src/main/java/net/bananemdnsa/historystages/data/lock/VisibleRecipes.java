/**
 * The recipe list with everything a locked global stage gates taken out.
 *
 * <p>A station that asks "which of your recipes fits what is inside me" is answered one recipe at
 * a time, and the gate has always sat on that answer. A station that instead takes the whole list
 * and searches it itself never met the gate at all — which is why Create's mixing and compacting
 * stayed craftable inside a locked stage while pressing on the belt, on the very same machine, was
 * blocked. One asks, the other reads. Most modded machines read, because a custom recipe type
 * leaves them no other option.
 *
 * <p>Global stages only, on purpose. A list has no player attached, so there is nobody to resolve
 * an individual stage against — the same limit the editor warns about when a recipe is put on an
 * individual stage.
 *
 * <p>Cached because the list runs to thousands of entries and the machines reading it read it
 * again every few ticks. The answer is rebuilt when the unlocked set changes, when a stage's
 * contents change, and when recipes reload — never in between. All three are read from counters
 * rather than pushed in, so a fourth place that changes one of them cannot forget to report.

     * now come out different — so the honest question is not "did a stage change" but "did the set
     * of hidden recipes change", and that can simply be worked out and compared. It answers for

     * {@code recipe}, including one reached through a tag or a mod id.

     * <p>A stage that gates only blocks, biomes or mobs therefore costs nothing here, and neither
     * does saving a stage in the editor without touching what it gates.
     *
     * <p>Walks every recipe once, which is the same walk the filter above does when it rebuilds —
     * a few milliseconds against the seconds a reload costs on a large pack.
