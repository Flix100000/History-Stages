 * One kind of thing a stage can gate — items, tags, mods, dimensions, and so on.

 * <p>A category is a <em>view</em> over a {@link StageEntry}, not a store. The entries still
 * live in the same typed fields they always have, and the on-disk format is unchanged; the
 * category just makes them reachable without naming the field. That is what lets code stop
 * repeating itself eleven times, and what a later phase turns into a public registration point
 * for addons.
 *
 * <p>The unit is the <em>editor tab</em>, not the JSON key: attack, spawn and interaction locks
 * are three categories even though all three are stored inside one {@code entities} object.
 *
 * @param <T> the entry type this category stores — {@code String} for plain id lists,
 *            {@code ItemEntry} where NBT and lock actions are possible, and so on.
