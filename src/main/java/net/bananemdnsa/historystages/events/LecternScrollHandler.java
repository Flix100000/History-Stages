/**
 * Opens the open scroll document when a lectern holding one is right-clicked.
 *
 * <p>The lectern's own menu is no use to us: {@code LecternBlockEntity.hasBook()} hard-checks for
 * written and writable books, so it reports false for our scroll and the container invalidates
 * itself the moment it opens. The block entity also never syncs its item, so the reader's client
 * cannot learn the stage on its own — the server has to say it.
 *
 * <p>Also puts an open scroll onto an empty lectern, which 1.20.1 will not do on its own — see
 * {@link #tryPlaceScroll}.
 *
 * <p>The reading half is server-side only, for that same reason: a client sees an empty {@code getBook()} and could
 * never recognise the case. Nothing is lost by it. {@code ServerPlayerGameMode.useItemOn} sends
 * the interaction packet regardless of what the local prediction returns, so the server always
 * sees the click, and {@code LecternBlock.use} guards {@code openScreen} behind
 * {@code !level.isClientSide()} — the client's prediction is the same arm swing any lectern gives.
 *
 * <p>Two further consequences of that {@code hasBook()} check are harmless but surprising: a
 * comparator on a scroll lectern reads a constant 14, because the page count stays 0, and
 * {@code page} loads back as -1 after a world restart ({@code Mth.clamp(0, 0, -1)}). Only the 14
 * is ever read by this mod, and the page is never read at all.
