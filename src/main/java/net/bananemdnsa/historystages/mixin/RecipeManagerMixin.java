/**
 * Where a recipe lock is actually enforced.
 *
 * <p>There are three ways to reach a recipe, and they are gated differently on purpose.
 *
 * <p><strong>Asking</strong> — "which of your recipes fits what is inside me" — is gated, on both
 * sides. That is every vanilla station and most of Create.
 *
 * <p><strong>Reading the list</strong> — taking every recipe, or every recipe of one type, and
 * searching it yourself — is gated on the server only. A custom recipe type leaves a modded
 * machine no other option, so this is how most of them work; Create's basin is the visible case,
 * and it is why mixing and compacting stayed craftable inside a locked stage while pressing on the
 * belt, on the very same machine, was blocked. It stays unfiltered on the client because there the
 * same lists are what the player is allowed to <em>see</em>: JEI and EMI draw locked recipes with
 * a lock on them, the editor's picker has to find a recipe that is already locked or nobody could
 * ever unlock it again, and the fluid index reads every recipe there is.
 *
 * <p><strong>Looking one up by its id</strong> is <em>not</em> gated, and that is a decision rather
 * than an omission. A player's recipe book is a list of recipe ids in their player file, resolved
 * through {@code byKey} on every login; an id that does not resolve is not skipped but dropped,
 * logged as "unrecognized recipe, removed now", and the shortened book is written back on logout.
 * Gating it would quietly delete recipes players had already earned, once per login, for good —
 * an unlock afterwards would not bring them back. Awarding a recipe from an advancement goes the
 * same way, and so does the experience a furnace owes for what it smelted. Against that it buys
 * almost nothing: nothing in vanilla crafts through it, and placing a recipe from the book still
 * has to pass the resolution above.
 *
 * <p>{@code getOrderedRecipes} is left alone for the same reason as the client: it fills the
 * packet every client is sent on join and after a reload, and our own scanners read it when they
 * need every recipe there is.
 *
 * <p>The gate lives inside these method bodies, which means a mod that puts its own subclass of
 * the recipe manager in place and overrides them is not gated at all. That is not hypothetical —
 * FastSuite does it, and {@code mixin/fastsuite/AuxRecipeManagerMixin} hooks the overrides. The
 * two answers such a hook needs are reached through {@link RecipeResolutionFilter} rather than
 * copied, so there is still only one gate.
