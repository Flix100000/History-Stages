New here? ../CONTRIBUTING.md explains which branch to target, how to build the mod,
and what we look for in a review.

Translating? Languages that are on Crowdin (https://crowdin.com/project/history-stages)
are translated there, not through a pull request. Crowdin overwrites those files on every
sync, so a PR for them would get lost. A pull request is only the right way for a
language that is not on Crowdin yet.

## Testing (required)
<!-- How did you actually test this? Be specific. -->

**Environment:**
- Minecraft version: <!-- e.g. 1.20.1, 1.21.1 -->
- Mod loader + version: <!-- e.g. Forge 47.4.18, NeoForge 21.1.222, Fabric 0.16.x -->
- Branch this PR targets: <!-- e.g. main, neoforge-1.21, fabric-1.21 -->
- Environment: <!-- Singleplayer / Dedicated Server + Client / both -->
- Other mods loaded during test: <!-- e.g. JEI, KubeJS, Curios, or "none" -->

**What I tested:**
-
-

**What I did not test (but probably should):**
-

## Compatibility Check
- [ ] Existing stage JSON files still load without errors
- [ ] Existing config keys still work (or migration is handled)
- [ ] No client-only code runs on the dedicated server side (e.g. no `Minecraft.getInstance()` / client config reads on server)
- [ ] No server-only code runs on the client side
- [ ] Loader-specific code is properly guarded (`@OnlyIn`, loader-specific source sets, or service abstraction)

## Checklist (required)
- [ ] `gradlew build` passes locally
- [ ] Changes follow the existing code style of the project
- [ ] Public APIs / commands / events are documented in code or readme where appropriate
- [ ] Version number / changelog updated (if this is release-bound)
